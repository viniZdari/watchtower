Logic Master Lm90 is a DOS-based software that allows you to program and communicate with GE Fanuc Series 90-30, 90-20 and Micro PLCs. It is an older software that has been replaced by newer Windows-based tools such as VersaPro and Cimplicity Machine Edition, but it is still useful for working with legacy PLCs that may not be compatible with the newer software.

In this article, we will show you how to download and install Logic Master Lm90 software on your PC, and how to connect it to your GE Fanuc PLC using a serial cable and an SNP adapter.
 
## Step 1: Download Logic Master Lm90 Software
 
Logic Master Lm90 software is not available for purchase or download from the official GE Fanuc website, as it is no longer supported or distributed by them. However, you can still find it online from various sources, such as forums, e-commerce sites or demo discs. For example, you can download it from this link[^1^], which was posted by a user on a PLC forum. Alternatively, you can buy a CD package that contains the software and manuals from this site[^3^].
 
Before you download or buy the software, make sure that your PC meets the minimum system requirements for running Logic Master Lm90. According to the user manual[^3^], you need:
 
- A PC with an Intel 386 processor or higher
- At least 4 MB of RAM
- At least 10 MB of free hard disk space
- A floppy disk drive
- A VGA monitor
- A mouse
- A serial port (COM1 or COM2)
- DOS 5.0 or higher

Once you have downloaded or bought the software, you need to copy it to your PC. If you have downloaded it from the internet, you need to unzip the file and copy the contents to a folder on your hard drive. If you have bought the CD package, you need to insert the CD into your PC and copy the files from the CD to a folder on your hard drive.
 
## Step 2: Install Logic Master Lm90 Software
 
To install Logic Master Lm90 software on your PC, you need to run the setup program that is located in the folder where you copied the software files. To do this, you need to open a DOS command prompt and navigate to the folder where you copied the software files. For example, if you copied the files to C:\LM90, you need to type:

    C:
    CD \LM90
    SETUP

The setup program will guide you through the installation process. You will need to accept the license agreement, choose a destination folder for the software (the default is C:\LM90), and select the components that you want to install (the default is all components). The setup program will also create a shortcut for Logic Master Lm90 on your desktop.
 
After the installation is complete, you need to restart your PC for the changes to take effect.
 
## Step 3: Connect Logic Master Lm90 Software to GE Fanuc PLC
 
To connect Logic Master Lm90 software to your GE Fanuc PLC, you need a serial cable and an SNP adapter. The serial cable connects your PC's serial port (COM1 or COM2) to the SNP adapter, and the SNP adapter connects to the PLC's programming port (usually located on the CPU module). The SNP adapter converts the RS-232 signal from your PC to an RS-485 signal that is compatible with GE Fanuc PLCs.
 
The serial cable and SNP adapter are not included with Logic Master Lm90 software, so you need to buy them separately. You can find them online from various sources, such as eBay or Amazon. For example, you can buy this serial cable and this SNP adapter from Amazon.
